# 🎬 **Movie Recommendation System**

## 📘 **Project Overview**

This project builds a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on similarity.
It analyzes movie features such as genre, overview, keywords, cast, and crew to recommend the most relevant films.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

* Recommend movies similar to a selected movie
* Use content-based filtering techniques
* Convert text features into numerical vectors
* Measure similarity between movies

---

## 🛠 **Techniques Used**

* **Content-Based Recommendation**
* **Text Preprocessing** (cleaning, stemming, tokenization)
* **Feature Engineering**
* **CountVectorizer / TF-IDF Vectorization**
* **Cosine Similarity**

---

## 📂 **Project Files**

* `movie_recommendations.ipynb` – Notebook with full implementation
* `README.md` – Project summary

---

## 🔍 **Workflow**

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Combine important text features
3. Convert text into numerical vectors
4. Compute cosine similarity
5. Build a function to recommend top similar movies

---

## 📈 **Output**

* Top 5 or Top 10 recommended movies for any selected movie
* Easy-to-understand similarity results
* Clean visualizations (if included)

---

## 🚀 **Applications**

* OTT platforms (Netflix, Prime, Hotstar)
* Personalized movie suggestions
* User preference modeling
* Entertainment analytics
